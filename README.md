This repo is a collection of random scripts. Some are useful and will be documented.

### drive.sh

![drive.sh in action](https://i.imgur.com/7vvWdOl.png)

This script uses ```dmenu``` and ![gdrive](https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive). After ![gdrive](https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive) is configured, run ```./drive.sh``` and you can browse your drive locally to fetch the file you need. Currently is only supports fetching files and not whole directories. A recursive fetch will be added later.
